## Software Requirements

<h4>VS Code</h4>
First thing we need to do is download and install Microsoft VS Code. VS Code is one of NetSuite's preferred IDE's, which makes it ideal for what we're doing here.<br />

<h4>Homebrew</h4>
Assuming you're developing on Mac, you will want to download and install homebrew on your computer. Homebrew is a fairly standard package manager used for OSX and will help you install other software packages such as the Java Development Kit we will need.<br />
