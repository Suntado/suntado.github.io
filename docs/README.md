# Welcome to Suntado's Developer Documentation.

These docs are designed to try and make developing software for our systems a little less stressful. Below you will find links to different parts of our documentation that should help you get started right away.

> How are these docs built?

These docs are built using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), and simple markup files hosted using our GitHub Organization. For more information refer to their documentation on how to edit these pages.
